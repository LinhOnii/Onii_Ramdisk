## **⚙️ How It Works**  
### **🔍 Understanding the Checkm8 Exploit**  
Checkm8 is a **BootROM vulnerability** that allows permanent **jailbreaking** and **bypassing security checks** on affected devices. Since BootROM is stored in **read-only memory (ROM)**, this exploit **cannot be patched** by Apple.  

### **🚀 Bypass Process**  
1. **DFU Mode Exploitation:**  
   - Uses **"use-after-free"** vulnerability in BootROM’s USB handling.  
2. **Heap Manipulation:**  
   - Controls memory allocation to **execute arbitrary code**.  
3. **Payload Injection:**  
   - Injects shellcode to **disable security checks**.  
4. **Bypassing Hello Screen:**  
   - Skips Apple's authentication and **grants access to the OS**.
