Mechanism of Operation: Technical Analysis of the Checkm8 Exploit
Introduction
The Checkm8 exploit takes advantage of an unpatchable vulnerability in the BootROM of most iDevices, including the iPhone X. This article provides a technical analysis of this vulnerability and its root cause.

iDevice Boot Process
BootROM is the first piece of code executed when an iDevice powers on.
Its main responsibilities include:
Platform initialization
Verification and transfer of control
Processing IMG3/IMG4 images
Accessing GID keys for decryption
Restoring the device if it cannot boot normally
History of Checkm8
Checkm8 was added to ipwndfu by axi0mX on September 27, 2019.
The exploit is based on a use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability in the USB stack of BootROM.
This vulnerability was first discovered in iBoot patches for iOS 12 beta in the summer of 2018.
Essential USB Information
In DFU mode, only Control Transfers are used for data transmission.
Data transfer occurs in three stages:
Setup Stage
Data Stage
Status Stage
Analysis of apollo.txt
Describes the DFU mode algorithm and verifies it with the iBoot source code.
The use-after-free vulnerability occurs when a SETUP packet is sent during the image loading process, but the transaction is completed without a Data Stage.
Checkm8 Exploit Analysis
Heap grooming (heap feng-shui) – Arranging memory allocations for controlled exploitation.
Buffer allocation and release – Creating an exploitable state in IO buffers without clearing global variables.
Overwriting usb_device_io_request – Exploiting the use-after-free condition.
Injecting the payload – Placing custom shellcode into device memory.
Executing callback-chain – Gaining control of execution flow.
Running shellcode – Modifying device behavior and bypassing security checks.
Conclusion
The Checkm8 exploit is a fascinating vulnerability with major implications for jailbreakers and security researchers. Since BootROM is stored in read-only memory (ROM), this vulnerability cannot be patched by Apple, making it a permanent attack vector for affected devices. This significantly lowers the cost and complexity of researching Apple devices.

How It Works: Using Checkm8 to Bypass the Hello Screen
Exploiting the "Use-After-Free" Vulnerability in DFU Mode
When an iOS device is in DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode, Checkm8 exploits a use-after-free vulnerability in BootROM’s USB code.
This flaw allows an attacker to overwrite freed memory, gaining control over critical data structures in BootROM.
Heap Grooming (Heap Feng-Shui)
Carefully manipulates memory allocation to control heap memory layout.
Sends strategic USB requests to create gaps in memory for controlled allocation.
Overwriting the usb_device_io_request Structure
After heap manipulation, Checkm8 triggers the use-after-free bug to overwrite usb_device_io_request.
This step is crucial for taking control of BootROM execution flow.
Injecting the Payload into Memory
A custom payload is loaded into device memory.
This modifies BootROM behavior, bypassing security checks.
Executing Callback-Chain
A series of function calls are executed to:
Disable WXN (Write-Xor-Execute) protections
Transfer execution control to shellcode
Running the Shellcode
The shellcode modifies system state, bypassing Apple’s authentication and security checks.
It may alter memory values to bypass the Hello screen and gain access to the OS.
Bypassing the Hello Screen
The Hello screen is part of Apple's activation process, requiring authentication with Apple servers.
With Checkm8, an attacker takes control of BootROM, modifying the boot process to skip activation checks.
The shellcode mimics valid authentication, making the system believe the device is properly activated.
Summary
The Checkm8 vulnerability follows a complex multi-stage exploitation process to gain control of BootROM, bypassing Apple’s security mechanisms. Since BootROM resides in read-only memory (ROM), this exploit is permanent and cannot be patched through software updates. This makes it a powerful tool for researchers, jailbreakers, and forensic analysis.

⚠️ Important Notice:
Please ensure that the iPhone you are unlocking is legitimately owned and locked for a valid reason. This software is built solely for educational purposes and to assist users in rightful situations. If anyone attempts to use it for commercial gain, I will have no choice but to shut it down to protect my reputation.
